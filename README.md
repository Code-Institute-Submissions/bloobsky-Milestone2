# Project Info

HiVE Cluster - Smart Home Interface is a fully functional website that enables user to take control of his/her house.

System is just a proposition for the assignement @ www.CodeInstitute.Net and it only works as a presentation.

In the future if I have enough knowledge I might upgrade it towards existing system like: Amazon Alexa, Google Home etc...

Page is divided into 6 anchor point and gives user ability to go through different options in order to fully controll smarthome.

1) Main - Usefull information how the system work and describes all the functions available to the user.
2) House plan - Shows 2 floors and gives user ability to control each light in every room seperately and remotely.
3) Controls - enables user to setup the alarm, open garage or use lockdown mode to close every entrance to the house.
4) Emergency (Panic Button) - within one click our team would be informed that something is wrong or doesn't work withing your home.
5) Map - withing using of Google Maps would return the location of your home ()
6) FAQ - Frequently Asked Questions for general help or enquires.
